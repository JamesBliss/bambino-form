# Form

The `<Form />` component is the most imported element of the puzzle, it controls the flow and logic of all that reside within it.

`<Form />` is simply the place you set a parent schema, initial data set and the sumbit fuction.

- `schema` is optional because as we all know sometimes you don't need validation and on top of that sometimes you want to specify validation on a per field level.
- `initialData` is optional because again sometimes you don't want to have a blank object at the top of you component. The data structure will be created dynamically based on the fields within the form.


## Props

<Props of={ Form } />

## Basic usage

<Playground sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms">
  <Form onSubmit={ data => alert(JSON.stringify(data)) }>
    <h1>Add any content / elements</h1>
    <Input
      name='name'
      placeholder='Enter name'
      schema={ string().required('name is required') }
    />
    {/* This is required because docz doesn't support form submission ü§¶‚Äç */}
    <Context.Consumer>
      { ({ handleSubmit }) => (
        <button onClick={ (e) => handleSubmit(e) }>Submit name </button>
      )}
    </Context.Consumer>
  </Form>
</Playground>
