# Bambino Form

Tired of being locked to passing in a top level schema or empty version of your data stucture? Sure you can still do that but you can also build up both your validation schema and data object based on your markup!

## What makes it special?

Well like other form libaries this is designed to be flexible, fast, easy, logical and a whole lot of other adjectives but honestly this is how my mind wants forms to work.

It does use some of thoes fancy new React things...

- hooks
- context

## What it doesn't offer?

It doesn't offer any actual UI components, it does have a `<Input />` `<Select />` + `<Check />` but these really are just to help get forms prototyped and help understand how the library works.
